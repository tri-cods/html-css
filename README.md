# Introduction to HTML and CSS

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create and organize the content of a website. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for design and layout. Together, these languages form the foundation of what one needs to know to create websites that are useful and well-designed. The purpose of this workshop is to help participants understand the rudiments of front-end web development, with the intention of providing a strong base of knowledge from which to imagine web-based digital humanities projects.

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Familiarize themselves with the anatomy of a webpage and how the Internet works.
- Understand the basics of the HTML and CSS markup languages.
- Use HTML, CSS, and a text editor to build a small website.

## Why learn HTML & CSS?

Whether or not you plan on developing a website from  scratch, understanding the basics of HTML & CSS is important for a variety of uses.

- Troubleshooting no-code web editors and content management systems
- Formatting and customizing web publishing tools such as ArcGIS Online, Timeline JS, Storymaps JS, WordPress or courseware software like Moodle
- Extracting structured data from a website (i.e. web scraping)
